# docscan [Live Website](https://subrat-lima.github.io/docscan/)
A basic web application to convert doc images to pdf.

## Purpose
In this digital era, every now and then, we need some documents in pdf format for verification and such. However, because of problems like bloatware interfaces, overwhelming amount of customization or network constraints many have trouble converting. I tried to handle those concerns by trying to make it as simple and clutter free as possible. Also, as all work is done entirely in client side, there is no need to worry about network latency and data consumption for those huge files.

## Features
* Minimalist interface
* Convert Multiple files at once
* Crop Images
* Fully functional offline (PWA)

## Libraries
[cropperjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs): For image cropping functionality.

Huge thanks to the developers of these libraries.
